                <h2>Hello, I'm [Your Name]</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Notebook and Nest! I'm a homeschooling mom and PhD candidate in English Literature, navigating the beautiful intersection of raising readers and becoming a scholar.</p>
                
                <p>My days are filled with read-alouds, math lessons, nature walks, and research on children's literature‚Äîspecifically how speculative fiction explores themes of sacrifice, innocence, and growing up. From Tolkien to contemporary middle grade authors, I'm fascinated by how stories shape young minds and imaginations.</p>
                
                <p>I live in Maine with my family, where we embrace the changing seasons through nature study, outdoor adventures, and plenty of hot cocoa by the fire. Our homeschool is eclectic and literature-rich, drawing from classical education, Charlotte Mason principles, and our own interests.</p>

            <h2>About This Blog</h2>
            <p>Notebook and Nest is where my two worlds meet. In my "notebook," I share my academic journey‚Äîresearch insights, book recommendations, and reflections on children's literature and literary theory. In my "nest," I document our homeschooling adventures‚Äîcurriculum choices, what's working (and what's not), and the everyday joys of learning alongside my children.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're a fellow homeschooler, a lover of children's literature, an academic parent, or simply curious about how these paths can intertwine, I hope you'll find something here that resonates.</p>
            
            <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
            <p><strong>Homeschool Reflections:</strong> Practical tips, curriculum reviews, day-in-the-life posts, and honest reflections on the homeschool journey.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Literary Explorations:</strong> Book recommendations, discussions of children's and young adult literature, and insights from my academic research.</p>
